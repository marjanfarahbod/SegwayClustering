# Here I do checks and QC with relevance to the transcriptomic data
##
#For this task we need three input files:
#
#- This is the exact GTF: https://www.encodeproject.org/files/gencode.v29.primary_assembly.annotation_UCSC_names/ genomic coordinates used for Segtools
#- The RNA-seq data for the sample(s)
#- The annotations with class labels (the initial sample with the transcript data name:H1 ID:ENCSR938GXK)
