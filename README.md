### The GTF file used for gene coordinates

For this task we need three initial input files:

- The GTF file (contains gene coordinates): we use the file used for running some segtool commands for this ENCODE runs: https://www.encodeproject.org/files/gencode.v29.primary_assembly.annotation_UCSC_names/ genomic coordinates used for Segtools
